<p>I programmed this digital dash display for UCR's Society of Automotive Engineers
    first ever Electric Car for the national FSAE competition. The back end of the display
    is written in C# to handle the input coming from the vehicle's computer to the dash display.
    The display changes its physical assets held with XML based of the logic programmed in C#.
    And the information is received serially Using the CAN interface, which is the standard
    used to send information in cars</p>
