<p>The Morning Information Hub M.I.H. is an alarm and information hub used to start your day. Its alarm functionality will be connected to an 16x32 LED matrix powered by an Arduino that receives information from the Atmega1284p chip via usart which will wake the user up with light to simulate the sunrise in order to provide a more pleasant experience than the traditional alarm, but as a failsafe there will be an alarm that rings after 5 minutes in case the user does not wake up from the light. The alarm will be initiated as a countdown timer because Atmega does not contain a time functionality. The user will interact with the M.I.H. through bluetooth and their phone. The M.I.H.â€™s current function will be determined by the input received by the bluetooth input.</p>
